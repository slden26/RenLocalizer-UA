### 📝 Release Notes
- **Version bump to 2.4.8.** Small stability and UX improvements.
- **Fix:** Ensure TL folder dialog receives the active `TranslationManager` to prevent UI crashes when launching TL translation from Tools (fixes a crash on some window setups).

### ⚙️ Comments
- This release focuses on small but impactful quality-of-life fixes after 2.4.7; no breaking API changes.
