# Changelog

## [2.0.7] - 2025-11-27

### 🧠 Parser & Extraction
- **Context-aware parser core:** Rebuilt `src/core/parser.py` with an indentation-based context stack so dialogue, menus, screen text and inline Ren'Py helpers are classified with their structural metadata.
- **Multiline + extend handling:** Triple-quoted dialogue, narrator blocks and `extend` statements are now captured as a single entry with accurate line ranges, preventing duplicate/partial translations.
- **Placeholder preservation:** Placeholders such as `{color}` tags, `[player]` variables and interpolation markers are cached before translation and re-applied after, reducing accidental corruption during MT runs.
- **Structured entry output:** Downstream consumers now receive `text`, `processed_text`, `context_path`, `text_type`, `character` and `placeholder_map`, unlocking smarter filtering and future glossary tooling.

### 🎛️ UnRen Automation & UX
- **UnRen Mode dialog:** Added `UnRenModeDialog` that guides users through automatic vs manual UnRen runs with localized descriptions.
- **Automation script:** `_build_unren_auto_script()` now streams a deterministic command sequence (`extract → decompile → exit`, keep `.rpa`, extract all, no overwrite) so unattended runs just work.
- **Embedded logging:** Automatic runs capture stdout and present completion feedback inside the GUI instead of leaving users guessing.
- **UnRen re-download tooling:** `Tools → Redownload UnRen` forces a fresh package fetch when corruption or updates are detected.
- **Info dialog update:** The multi-page Info Center now ships with an UnRen tab explaining when/why to use automatic vs manual flows.
- **Version chooser guidance:** Help → Info → UnRen now tells users exactly when to launch `UnRen-current.bat` versus `UnRen-legacy.bat`, synchronized across English and Turkish locales.

### 🌍 Localization
- **Turkic language detection:** `detect_system_language()` now treats Turkish plus Azeri, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, Tatar (and similar locales) as “Turkish UI” defaults, while other systems stay English.
- **README refresh:** Both English and Turkish READMEs were rewritten to cover the new UnRen workflow, Info Center, and language defaults.

### 🧪 Regression Safety
- **Legacy compatibility shim:** `extract_translatable_text()` still exposes the historical `Set[str]` interface so existing tests/scripts continue to work while the GUI migrates to structured entries.
- **Logging & diagnostics:** Parser errors now include file and block context, making it easier to triage problematic `.rpy` files reported by users.

## [2.0.6] - 2025-11-26

### 🎨 UI Simplification & UX
- **Minimal main window:** Simplified the main screen to only show project folder selection, basic translation settings and a progress section so new users are not overwhelmed.
- **Removed results/log tabs:** The old right-hand panel with `Translation Results`, `Extracted Texts` and log tabs has been removed; extracted texts are now written to simple `.txt` reports under `logs/`.
- **Settings-only advanced options:** Advanced performance, proxy and logging options are now managed exclusively via the `Settings` dialog instead of the main window.
- **Window size cleanup:** Removed window size persistence and the related controls in Settings; the app now opens with a sane default size instead of reusing previous large/fullscreen sizes.

### 🌐 Glossary, Proxy & Localization
- **Glossary editor dialog:** Added a dedicated `Glossary` menu entry and dialog to edit `glossary.json` (term → preferred translation) with immediate in-memory update.
- **Config‑driven proxy manager:** Proxy behaviour is now fully driven by `Proxy` settings (enable/disable, failure limit, update interval and startup testing) instead of hardcoded values.
- **Custom proxy list support:** You can now define your own proxy list in the `Proxy` tab; these entries are parsed and preferred over public proxy sources.
- **Locale updates:** Updated English and Turkish locale files to match the new minimal UI and removed obsolete Quick Options/OPUS-MT related strings.
 - **Expanded translation language list:** Greatly extended the supported source/target languages (Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Greek, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Indonesian, Malay, Hebrew and more) via `get_supported_languages`, so most major world languages can now be selected.

### 📚 Documentation
- **README refresh:** Updated both `README.md` and `README.tr.md` to describe the minimal main window, current theme options and the separate Settings dialog.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-09-16

### 🧹 Removal: Deep-Translator
- **Removed Deep-Translator:** The experimental `Deep-Translator` multi-engine wrapper and its UI entry have been removed due to stability and maintenance reasons. If you relied on this engine, please switch to supported engines (Google, DeepL, Yandex, LibreTranslator).

### 🧹 Removal: OPUS-MT (Argos Translate)
- **Removed OPUS-MT (Argos Translate):** All OPUS-MT / Argos Translate integration, model download UI, and related code paths have been removed due to instability and crashes observed in production. Offline model download/dialog features related to OPUS-MT were deleted, and references in UI/locales/docs were cleaned up.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-09-15

### 🛠️ RenPy Compliance & Cleanup
- **Config Cleanup:** Only `config.py` is now active; `config_new.py` and `config_old.py` have been completely removed.
- **Default Format:** The default translation output format is now `old_new`. The `simple` format remains as an optional legacy mode.
- **Format Compliance:** The `old_new` format is now fully compliant with RenPy documentation. All translations are grouped in a single `translate [lang] strings:` block, with each entry as `old "..."` and `new "..."`, and file/directory structure matches RenPy standards.
- **Language Init File:** The automatic language initializer file (e.g. `a0_pt_language.rpy`) is now minimal: only `define config.language = "[lang]"` is used for automatic language selection. All complex init/python blocks have been removed.
- **Bug Fixes:** Fixed quote and newline issues in language init file generation; output is now error-free.
- **Code & Documentation:** All relevant code sections and README/BUILD.md have been reviewed and updated for RenPy compliance and accuracy.
- **User Feedback:** Language initialization issues (e.g. for Portuguese) are resolved; automatic language selection now works for all languages.
